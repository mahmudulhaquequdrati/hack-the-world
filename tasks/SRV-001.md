## 📋 Purpose

Fix broken test environment so we can run tests for all other tasks. Currently 52 tests are failing due to validation and setup issues.

## 🎯 Requirements

- Fix Jest configuration and MongoDB memory server setup
- Ensure `pnpm test` runs successfully
- Add basic test utilities and helpers
- Resolve all validation and authentication issues

## 🔧 Current Issues Identified

- ❌ User registration validation failing (email validation issues)
- ❌ Authentication token generation problems
- ❌ Password comparison async/await bugs
- ❌ Test data setup inconsistencies
- ❌ Coverage below 80% threshold (currently 60.85%)

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `pnpm test` runs without errors
- [ ] All 138 tests passing (100% success rate)
- [ ] Code coverage above 80% for statements, branches, functions, lines
- [ ] Zero validation errors in user registration/login
- [ ] Proper JWT token generation and validation
- [ ] Clean test output without console errors

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

- [ ] Run `pnpm test` and verify it works
- [ ] Create sample model test to verify setup
- [ ] Fix all 52 failing tests
- [ ] Achieve minimum 80% code coverage

## 📝 Implementation Notes

- Fix async/await bugs in auth controller
- Repair user model validation issues
- Ensure MongoDB memory server setup works correctly
- Update test utilities and helpers
