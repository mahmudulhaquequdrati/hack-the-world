## 📋 Purpose

Store lab exercise details for hands-on cybersecurity practice with simplified structure for easy management.

## 🎯 Requirements

- Create Lab mongoose model with essential fields only
- Support basic lab information and requirements
- Keep schema simple and focused

## 📊 Optimized Simple Schema

```javascript
{
  title: String,                 // Lab title
  description: String,           // Lab description
  instructions: String,          // Step-by-step instructions
  difficulty: String,            // 'beginner', 'intermediate', 'advanced'
  estimatedTime: Number,         // Estimated completion time in minutes

  // Simple requirements
  tools: [String],               // Required tools ['nmap', 'burpsuite']
  targetSystem: String,          // Target system description

  // Basic scoring
  maxScore: Number,              // Maximum points possible
  hasAutoGrading: Boolean        // Whether auto-grading is available
}
```

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Model created with validation
- [ ] Difficulty enum validation (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
- [ ] Tools array supports cybersecurity tools
- [ ] Simple scoring system implemented
- [ ] Basic CRUD operations work

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

- [ ] Write model tests for all fields
- [ ] Test difficulty validation
- [ ] Test tools array functionality
- [ ] Test estimated time validation
- [ ] Test scoring fields

## 📝 Implementation Notes

- Keep schema simple - no complex nested objects
- Use enum validation for difficulty levels
- Tools array should support common cybersecurity tools
- EstimatedTime in minutes for consistency
- MaxScore as simple number field
