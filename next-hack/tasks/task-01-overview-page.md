## 🎯 Objective
Create the `/overview` page that displays all available courses organized by phases and modules, matching the original frontend functionality.

## 📋 Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Display all phases with modules in hierarchical structure
- [ ] Show enrollment status for authenticated users
- [ ] Handle unauthenticated users gracefully
- [ ] Implement course/module navigation
- [ ] Display progress indicators for enrolled courses
- [ ] Responsive design (mobile-first)

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Use Next.js App Router (`/app/overview/page.tsx`)
- [ ] Integrate with existing authentication context
- [ ] Call phases and modules APIs
- [ ] Handle loading and error states
- [ ] Maintain layout consistency (Header/Footer)

### API Endpoints Needed
- `GET /api/phases` - Get all phases
- `GET /api/modules/phase/[phaseId]` - Get modules by phase
- `GET /api/enrollments/user/me` - Get user enrollments (if authenticated)

## 🏗️ Component Structure

```
app/overview/page.tsx
├── Layout wrapper
├── OverviewHeader component
├── PhaseCard components
│   ├── Phase info display
│   ├── ModuleCard components
│   └── Enrollment actions
└── Loading/Error states
```

### Components to Create/Migrate
- [ ] `OverviewHeader.tsx` - Page header with title and description
- [ ] `PhaseCard.tsx` - Individual phase display with modules
- [ ] `ModuleCard.tsx` - Module info with enrollment status
- [ ] `PhaseNavigation.tsx` - Phase filtering/navigation (if needed)

## 📊 Acceptance Criteria

### ✅ Must Have
- [ ] Page loads successfully at `/overview`
- [ ] All phases display correctly with their modules
- [ ] Authenticated users see enrollment status
- [ ] Unauthenticated users can browse but see call-to-action
- [ ] Navigation to individual module pages works
- [ ] Page is responsive on mobile devices
- [ ] Loading states during API calls
- [ ] Error handling for failed API requests

### 🚀 Should Have  
- [ ] Smooth animations/transitions
- [ ] Progress indicators for enrolled courses
- [ ] Search/filter functionality for courses
- [ ] Phase completion indicators

### 💎 Could Have
- [ ] Course recommendations
- [ ] Recently viewed courses
- [ ] Advanced filtering options
