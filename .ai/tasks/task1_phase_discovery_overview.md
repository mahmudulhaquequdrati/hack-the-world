## Description

Create the foundational phase discovery system allowing users to browse cybersecurity learning phases

## Details

- Create a `CyberSecOverview` component that displays all available learning phases
- Implement phase cards showing phase information (title, description, difficulty, modules count)
- Add cybersecurity-themed design with terminal styling and matrix effects
- Create phase data models and types based on the backend API structure
- Implement API integration to fetch phases from the backend server
- Add proper error handling and loading states
- Use the established color scheme (green terminal aesthetics)
- Ensure component follows the functional React component pattern
- Add responsive design for different screen sizes
- Include navigation to phase detail view
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for all data structures

## Test Strategy

- Verify phase cards display correctly with proper information
- Test API integration and error handling
- Confirm responsive design works on mobile and desktop
- Validate TypeScript interfaces match backend data structure
- Test navigation flow to phase details
