## 📋 Purpose

CRUD operations for labs with proper validation, error handling, and integration with ContentSection model.

## 🎯 Requirements

- Create basic CRUD endpoints for labs
- Connect to ContentSection model
- Implement proper validation and error handling
- Add lab-specific operations (scoring, progress tracking)

## 🛠️ API Endpoints to Implement

| Method | Endpoint        | Purpose        | Features              |
| ------ | --------------- | -------------- | --------------------- |
| GET    | `/api/labs`     | List all labs  | Filtering, pagination |
| GET    | `/api/labs/:id` | Get single lab | Full details          |
| POST   | `/api/labs`     | Create lab     | Validation            |
| PUT    | `/api/labs/:id` | Update lab     | Partial updates       |
| DELETE | `/api/labs/:id` | Delete lab     | Soft delete           |

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All endpoints implemented and working
- [ ] Basic validation and error handling
- [ ] Connects with ContentSection model
- [ ] Proper HTTP status codes
- [ ] Request/response validation

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

- [ ] Write API tests for all endpoints
- [ ] Test CRUD operations completely
- [ ] Test error scenarios (404, validation errors)
- [ ] Test ContentSection integration
- [ ] Test lab-specific field validation

## 📝 Implementation Notes

- Use express-validator for request validation
- Implement proper error responses
- Add pagination for lab listings
- Support filtering by difficulty, tools, etc.
- Validate tools array and scoring fields
