## 📋 Purpose

CRUD operations for games with proper validation, error handling, and integration with ContentSection model.

## 🎯 Requirements

- Create basic CRUD endpoints for games
- Connect to ContentSection model
- Implement proper validation and error handling
- Add game-specific operations (scoring, leaderboards)

## 🛠️ API Endpoints to Implement

| Method | Endpoint         | Purpose         | Features              |
| ------ | ---------------- | --------------- | --------------------- |
| GET    | `/api/games`     | List all games  | Filtering, pagination |
| GET    | `/api/games/:id` | Get single game | Full details          |
| POST   | `/api/games`     | Create game     | Validation            |
| PUT    | `/api/games/:id` | Update game     | Partial updates       |
| DELETE | `/api/games/:id` | Delete game     | Soft delete           |

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All endpoints implemented and working
- [ ] Basic validation and error handling
- [ ] Connects with ContentSection model
- [ ] Proper HTTP status codes
- [ ] Request/response validation

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

- [ ] Write API tests for all endpoints
- [ ] Test CRUD operations completely
- [ ] Test error scenarios (404, validation errors)
- [ ] Test ContentSection integration
- [ ] Test game-specific field validation

## 📝 Implementation Notes

- Use express-validator for request validation
- Implement proper error responses
- Add pagination for game listings
