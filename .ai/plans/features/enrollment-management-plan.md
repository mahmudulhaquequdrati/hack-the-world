A cybersecurity learner explores available modules and finds one that matches their interests. The system clearly shows they have the prerequisites and provides detailed information about the module commitment. With one click, they enroll and immediately gain access to the learning content. As they progress through the module, their enrollment status updates automatically, showing completion percentages and milestones. When they need to take a break, they can pause their enrollment and resume later without losing progress. Upon completion, they receive recognition for their achievement and recommendations for the next logical learning steps in their cybersecurity education journey.
