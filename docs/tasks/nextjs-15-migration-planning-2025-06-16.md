# Next.js 15+ Migration Planning

**Date**: 2025-06-16  
**Status**: Planning Complete - Awaiting User Approval  

## 🎯 Migration Overview

**Objective**: Migrate entire Hack The World platform from React+Vite to Next.js 15+ while preserving 100% functionality and design.

**Scope**:
- **Frontend** (Student Portal): React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + RTK Query → Next.js 15+ App Router
- **Admin Panel**: React 19 + JavaScript + Vite + Axios → Next.js 15+ App Router  
- **Backend**: Keep existing Express.js server unchanged
- **Architecture**: Create monorepo with shared UI library

## 📋 Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (Week 1-2)
- Setup pnpm monorepo workspace
- Initialize Next.js 15+ apps (web + admin)
- Create shared packages (ui, types, api-client, config)
- Configure TypeScript project references
- Setup TailwindCSS shared configuration

### Phase 2: Core System Migration (Week 2-4)
- Implement Next.js middleware for JWT validation
- Migrate localStorage token handling to server-side
- Map React Router routes to Next.js App Router
- Create shared API client package
- Migrate RTK Query for SSR compatibility

### Phase 3: Component Migration (Week 4-6)
- Migrate Shadcn/ui components to shared package
- Migrate all 100+ frontend components
- Migrate all 20+ admin components
- Preserve all interactive features (games, terminal, progress tracking)

### Phase 4: Testing & Optimization (Week 6-8)
- Migrate test suites to Next.js environment
- Implement SSR/SSG optimizations
- Performance optimization and benchmarking
- Complete feature parity validation

## 🏗️ Target Architecture

```

├── apps/
│   ├── web/                    # Student portal (Next.js 15+)
│   ├── admin/                  # Admin panel (Next.js 15+)
│   └── server/                 # Existing Express.js (unchanged)

```

## 🔧 Key Migration Decisions

1. **Monorepo Structure**: Enable component sharing between student and admin portals
2. **App Router**: Leverage Next.js App Router for better SSR/SSG capabilities
3. **Component Strategy**: 1:1 migration with minimal changes to preserve functionality
4. **Authentication**: Migrate from localStorage to Next.js middleware with server-side handling
5. **State Management**: Adapt RTK Query for SSR compatibility

## 🎯 Success Criteria

- ✅ 100% feature parity with current implementation
- ✅ Performance improvements from SSR/SSG
- ✅ Shared component library between apps
- ✅ Modern Next.js App Router architecture
- ✅ Zero breaking changes to user experience

## ⚠️ Risk Mitigation

**High Risk Areas**:
- RTK Query SSR migration complexity
- Authentication state management in SSR  
- Component migration testing (100+ components)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Phase-by-phase migration approach
- Comprehensive testing at each phase
- Backup and rollback procedures
- Feature parity validation gates

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: User approval for migration approach
2. **Upon Approval**: Begin Phase 1 infrastructure setup
3. **Continuous**: Update CLAUDE.md with progress and decisions
4. **Weekly**: Review milestone progress and adjust timeline

**Timeline**: 6-8 weeks with clear phase gates and quality validation

The migration preserves all existing functionality while modernizing to Next.js 15+ for better performance, SEO, and developer experience.
