## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express.js + TypeScript
- **Database**: MongoDB + Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library + Supertest
- **Deployment**: Docker + Cloud Platform

### Key Architectural Patterns

- **Single Source of Truth**: `frontend/src/lib/appData.ts`
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Reusable React components
- **RESTful API Design**: Standard HTTP methods and status codes
- **Security-First Approach**: Input validation, rate limiting, CORS
- **Test-Driven Development**: Unit tests for all features

## üìà Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics

- **Code Coverage**: Minimum 80% test coverage
- **Performance**: Page load time < 2 seconds
- **Security**: Zero critical vulnerabilities
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### User Experience Metrics

- **Course Completion Rate**: Target 60%
- **User Engagement**: Average session time > 15 minutes
- **Game Participation**: 80% of users play games
- **Lab Completion**: 50% complete at least one lab
