## 📋 Purpose

API endpoints for managing user enrollment in modules with proper validation and authentication.

## 🎯 Requirements

- Create enrollment management endpoints
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Handle enrollment validation and error cases
- Support enrollment status updates

## 🛠️ API Endpoints to Implement

| Method | Endpoint                       | Purpose                    | Features       |
| ------ | ------------------------------ | -------------------------- | -------------- |
| GET    | `/api/enrollments/:userId`     | Get user's enrollments     | User-specific  |
| POST   | `/api/enrollments`             | Enroll in module           | Authentication |
| PUT    | `/api/enrollments/:id/status`  | Update enrollment status   | Status changes |
| DELETE | `/api/enrollments/:id`         | Unenroll from module       | Soft delete    |
| GET    | `/api/modules/:id/enrollments` | Get module enrollment list | Module stats   |

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All endpoints implemented and working
- [ ] Authentication required for all operations
- [ ] Proper enrollment validation (no duplicates)
- [ ] Status update functionality working
- [ ] Module enrollment statistics available

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

- [ ] Write API tests for all endpoints
- [ ] Test authentication requirements
- [ ] Test enrollment validation logic
- [ ] Test status update operations
- [ ] Test error scenarios (already enrolled, etc.)

## 📝 Implementation Notes

- Require authentication for all enrollment operations
- Validate user cannot enroll in same module twice
- Support status updates (active/paused/dropped)
- Include enrollment statistics for modules
- Implement proper error handling for edge cases
