- ✅ **LOGIC IMPROVEMENT**: Only validate order conflicts when order is explicitly being changed by user
- ✅ **COMPOUND INDEX FIX**: Properly handle MongoDB compound unique index (phaseId + order) during updates
- ✅ **LOGGING**: Added console logging to track auto-assignment of orders during phase moves

**CRS-001 REQUIREMENTS**:

- ✅ **ISSUE**: Admin panel login fails with CORS error - "No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present"
- ✅ **ROOT CAUSE**: Server CORS configuration only allows `http://localhost:5173` (frontend), but admin panel needs access too
- ✅ **SOLUTION**: Update CORS configuration to allow multiple origins or use dynamic origin validation
- ✅ **TESTING**: Verify admin panel can successfully authenticate and make API calls

**CORS FIX STATUS**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Multiple origin support implemented, admin panel authentication working
