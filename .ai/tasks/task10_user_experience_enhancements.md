## Description

Implement loading states, error handling, and performance optimizations

## Details

- Create comprehensive loading states for all async operations
- Implement skeleton screens for better perceived performance
- Build error boundaries and graceful error handling
- Add toast notifications for user feedback and confirmations
- Create offline support and connectivity status indicators
- Implement progressive loading and lazy loading for content
- Add performance monitoring and optimization
- Create smooth animations and transitions using Framer Motion
- Implement keyboard shortcuts and accessibility improvements
- Add help system and onboarding tutorials
- Create user preference management (themes, settings)
- Build feedback collection and bug reporting system
- Add performance analytics and user behavior tracking
- Implement A/B testing framework for UX improvements

## Test Strategy

- Test loading states display correctly during async operations
- Verify error handling gracefully manages failures
- Confirm offline functionality works as expected
- Test animations and transitions perform smoothly
- Validate accessibility improvements with screen readers
- Test keyboard shortcuts and navigation
- Verify performance optimizations reduce load times
