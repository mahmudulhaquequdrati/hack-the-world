## Description

Comprehensive testing suite for all components and user flows

## Details

- Create unit tests for all React components using React Testing Library
- Implement integration tests for API interactions and data flow
- Build component test coverage for expected use cases, edge cases, and failure scenarios
- Create user flow tests for critical paths (enrollment, learning, progress tracking)
- Implement accessibility testing with automated tools and manual verification
- Add performance testing for loading times and responsiveness
- Create visual regression testing for UI consistency
- Build API mocking for reliable test execution
- Implement test utilities and helper functions for DRY testing
- Add code coverage reporting and quality gates
- Create automated testing pipeline with CI/CD integration
- Build cross-browser testing strategy and execution
- Implement mobile testing on real devices and emulators

## Test Strategy

- Run comprehensive test suite with minimum 80% code coverage
- Execute user flow tests for all critical application paths
- Perform accessibility audit with screen readers and automated tools
- Test performance benchmarks against established metrics
- Verify cross-browser compatibility on major browsers
- Test mobile functionality on iOS and Android devices
- Execute visual regression tests for UI consistency
