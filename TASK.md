**INVESTIGATION FINDINGS:**

- ✅ **LESSONS**: USER_LESSON_PROGRESS has 3 completed lessons for linux-basics (lessonIndex 0,1,2) - this is CORRECT
- ✅ **LABS**: linux-basics has 2 labs in LABS array: "file-system-mastery" & "command-line-fundamentals"
- ✅ **LABS PROGRESS**: USER_LAB_PROGRESS now shows 1/2 labs completed (file-system-mastery completed, command-line-fundamentals in progress)
- ✅ **LESSON TOTAL COUNT**: linux-basics has 4 topics, so 4 lessons total (1 lesson per topic for beginner modules)

**FIXES COMPLETED:**

- ✅ Added completed lab progress for "file-system-mastery" in linux-basics
- ✅ Verified lesson total count calculation (4 lessons = 4 topics for beginner modules)
- ✅ Progress now shows: linux-basics lessons (3/4), labs (1/2), games (0/2) - ALL ACCURATE
- ✅ All progress displays now use consistent data from USER_LESSON_PROGRESS and USER_LAB_PROGRESS

**FIX COMPLETED:**

- ✅ **Total Lessons**: Now calculated from `course.curriculum.reduce((total, section) => total + section.lessons, 0)`
- ✅ **Total Labs**: Now calculated from `course.labsData.length` (what user sees in course)
- ✅ **Total Games**: Now calculated from `course.gamesData.length` (what user sees in course)
- ✅ **Completed Counts**: Still use actual IDs from GAMES/LABS arrays mapped to USER_GAME_PROGRESS/USER_LAB_PROGRESS
- ✅ **Result**: Progress calculation now matches exactly what users see in course content, not raw data arrays
